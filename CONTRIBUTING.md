## Pushing to Typst packages

Check out [Typst packages repo](https://github.com/typst/packages) to learn more about packages release pipeline.

I personally suggest the following steps :

1. fork the Typst packages repo
2. in the root directory, for every `x.y.z` version (if the current branch currently contains the `x.y.z` release):

   ```bash
   cp -r report path/to/fork/packages/preview/typographix-polytechnique-reports/x.y.z
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   cp -r slide path/to/fork/packages/preview/typographix-polytechnique-slides/x.y.z
   ```

   > [!caution]
   > Make sure not to include files that are gitignored like `.pdf`s or `.DS_Store` for macOS users.

3. PR your fork to publish the package.
