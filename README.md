# Typst Polytechnique slide template

A Typst template for Polytechnique student oral presentations.

> [!warning]
> The original Polytechnique template uses the **Georgia font**. This is a copyrighted font, so it could not be included directly within the template. For better results, **you are encouraged to [download](https://font.download/font/georgia-2) it** and add it to the project (simply upload the font files on the web app). In case of issue, see [font management in Typst](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text#parameters-font).
